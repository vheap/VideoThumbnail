# VideoThumbnail
Parse Media Files

• Inspect all common media formats and their properties, like Bitrate, Duration and Definition.

• Parse and cache any number of frames from a video and automatically compile them into a single-thumbnail with timestamps.

• Favorite and add custom tag to videos, then filter and sort them by properties.

• Lots more QoL features with high efficiency and multi-threading support. Speed varies on the system specs. but on average a  20 frames of a 1080p video would take 3 seconds to parse completely, which is later cached and loaded instantly using custom file checksums.

Utilizies ffmpeg for frame conversion.
